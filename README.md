# MotionForge: RepCountAI

## Exercise Recognition and Repetition Counting with Sensor Data

This data science project focuses on developing a machine learning model to analyze signal data from an accelerometer and a gyrometer. The goal is to predict the type of barbell exercises being performed and accurately count repetitions for each exercise.

### Technologies Used

The project leverages a variety of technologies to achieve its objectives:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
- **Pandas:** Used for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization and generating insightful plots.
- **NumPy:** Facilitates numerical operations on the data.
- **Scikit-learn:** Utilized for implementing and testing various machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow:** Employed for building and training neural networks.

### Project Workflow

The project follows a systematic approach involving several key steps:

#### 1. Data Collection
The dataset includes signal data from accelerometers and gyroscopes, capturing the motion patterns during barbell exercises.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and handling missing data.
- Normalizing and standardizing features for consistent input to the models.

#### 3. Feature Engineering
Extracting relevant features from the raw sensor data to enhance model performance.

#### 4. Data Visualization
Utilizing Matplotlib to visualize the characteristics of the dataset and gain insights into the relationships between features.

#### 5. Model Development
Implementing machine learning models, including neural networks using TensorFlow, to predict exercise types and count repetitions.

#### 6. Model Evaluation
Testing multiple algorithms through grid search and cross-validation to identify the best-performing model.
